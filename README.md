A simple python configuration library that works like Minecraft Forge's Config classes.
I was fed up by the fact that the ```configparser``` library had little to no support for comments on values 
and also support for restoring configurations from a corrupted state.
I also wanted a library that would validate that certain config values where of the correct type, so this is it.

## Backends
The only current backend is the ```configparser``` library, but I would might add support for more,
such as yaml, json, toml, etc.
