.. As You Wish documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the docs for the As You Wish library!
===================================================

`As You Wish <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbX1U1tx9aw>`_ is a simple configuration library.
It allows you to define config options and the library will automatically manage the config file.
This includes creating the file, and fixing it when it is corrupted.
I created it because I thought that the config parser library needed support for comments
and for restoring the config back from an invalid state.
